# Challenge1
- What was the challenge?
The challenge was to write a functioning script that could write its own script, the second script was to be called run.sh and in which it used an echo command. The first script was to make a group and a user, add the user to the group, give the user and group the power to execute certain priveledges.
- How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected to complete the first task of creating a script that could dictate instrutions to another script as we'd just learnt script writing the previuos lesson with Ben Hesketh. But I always knew it would be tough.
- What went well?
I felt comfortable writing the script and looking through qa community for help.
- What didn't go as planned?
I failed the task ultimately due to a lack of knowledge and technical difficulties. Creating the script within a script proved more difficult than I initially thought it would be. Pushing the script to github was very much a struggle for and will need practise.
- Possible improvements for future challenges.
Cleary outline the task objectives, collaborate more with my peirs and ask Ben Hesketh for help when a specific task proves itself too difficult for me.
